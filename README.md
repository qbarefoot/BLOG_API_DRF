# Blog_Python_API
-> A simple blog style API developed with Django Rest Framework.  Tinker with the API yourself or use it in a future project. 

-> It has token authentication, image uploading via Djoser and Pillow, so you will need to install both to use said features. I have put the documentation below to help. 

-> Pillow https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html

-> Djoser https://djoser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html
